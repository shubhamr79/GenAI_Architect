# Personalized Course Recommendation Engine

This project is a semantic search-powered Course Recommendation Engine that suggests the top-5 most relevant online courses based on a user's completed courses and interests. It uses embedding models to represent course descriptions and user queries in vector space, and retrieves the closest matches using a vector database. A Streamlit UI is provided for interactive exploration.
